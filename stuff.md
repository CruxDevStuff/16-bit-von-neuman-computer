#### already know a bit but learn more in detail: 
* base RISC-V instruction set 
* pipelining
* x86 assembly
* Look Up tables 

#### brand new things that you haven't learnt before because you are dumb:
* Karnaugh maps 
* specifics of CISC instruction set 
* I DONT KNOW WHAT I DONT KNOW

### things I already know:
* Adders(Half, Full) 
* Flip-Flops
* registers
* arm assembly 

#### Useful resources:
1. FPGA Architecture:
    * LUTs(Look up table) - https://hardwarebee.com/overview-of-lookup-tables-in-fpga-design/
    * Multiplexers - https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-does-an-fpga-work
